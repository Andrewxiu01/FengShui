    <h2>Heaven Luck</h2>
    <p>This is the luck that we are born with, pre-determined before birth and influenced by karma. Heaven Luck is created before we have the ability to make conscious choices.  
    </p>
        <p>We have little control over this type of Luck, however, having said that, our ultimate Destiny is still a choice.
        </p>
        <p> Heaven Luck is the blueprint that Heaven has gifted us with and contains the secrets that will lead us to our life’s purpose, or our soul’s purpose. 
        </p>
        <p>It allows you to decode vital information about yourself to gain clarity towards the world and about your life to date. It provides you with the wisdom to empower, so you can unlock your potential and move through life confidently.

    <h2>Earth Luck</h2>
    <p>This is the luck that we are born with, pre-determined before birth and influenced by karma. Heaven Luck is created before we have the ability to make conscious choices.  
    </p>
        <p>We are all energetic beings that vibrate at different frequencies. These energies, or Qi exist within our environment and can affect us very differently. Their impact can be positive or negative towards all aspects of our life, including our relationships, our health, our careers and our wealth.
        </p>
        <p>Classical Feng Shui is based on The Five Element Theory and helps reduce the negative energy around us while harnessing the benevolent energy in our surroundings to bring us prosperity, harmony and joy. 
        </p>
        <p>When you are aligned with the positive and prosperous forces that already exist within nature and the environment that you live in, you are sending signals to the universe that “you are capable of receiving”.

    <h2>Man Luck</h2>
    <p>This is the luck we create for ourselves – and the one luck we have complete control over. It is created from our very own thoughts, virtues, actions and ideas. It is what we achieve through our education, our talents, our behaviour and the work we do to reach our goals.  
    </p>
        <p>Man Luck includes our cultural and religious beliefs as well as the moral codes that we stand by, the charities we get involved in and our willingness to help others and the environment around us.
        </p>
        <p>This luck can be incredibly powerful and there are no limitations except for the ones we set ourselves. It is not only about our ‘awareness’ of what is right and what needs to be done, but actions we take to bring them to fruition.
        </p>
        <p>When we understand this aspect deeply and believe in the endless potential we possess within ourselves, we can really take our destiny into our own hands and turn the tide; we can transform something negative into possibilities. We can create miracles from crisis. We can literally manifest what we truly desire and create heaven on earth.
