            <strong>
            “The workplace is changing, becoming increasingly people-centric, so organisations competing for talent will need to be more supportive of their staff than ever before. Applying effective Classical Feng Shui in the new era is no longer the same, we must ensure that all employees in the company are considered. Employers need to start taking action now to adapt effectively to its evolution or they face significant financial repercussions.”

        <p>
            Employee Experience (EX) is a 2-dimensional way of looking at humans. Now we care about the entire Human Experience (HX) and our people to have a better lifestyle, leading to enhanced productivity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Feng Shui solutions delivering both positive Employee Experience (EX) and Human Experience (HX) is the mantra for all organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding people and how they perform work allows us to provide the right tools and deliver enhanced experiences. This provides personalised services that allow people to be better at what they do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organisations must have people and their experiences at their core. We all live in an experience-driven era. Seeking positive experiences with the technologies and services we use each day is more important than ever. These experiences need to be seamless as people move between the Workplace and the Workspace.
        </p>

            Applying effective Classical Feng Shui in the new era is no longer the same, we must ensure that all employees in the company are considered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Company must seriously consider and adopt the Top-Down approach and educate each employees on the important of Feng Shui not only in Workplace as well as the Workspace when they are working hybrid or at home. Good Feng Shui will bring out the positivity and productivity from employee.         </p>

            But contrary to popular belief, Feng Shui isn’t a way to decorate or a Chinese style of decor. Both a science and an art, Feng Shui is all about energy and attraction. The purpose is to create a space that triggers specific emotions and feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
            There isn’t just one way to Feng Shui a Workplace; it depends on the individuals and their professional goals, as well as what the room is being used for. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The main entrance signifies the Qi mouth of the office, so you need to ensure that there is no obstacles or blockage that prevent the Qi from flowing into the office. Beside this, you need to make sure the direction and location of the main door are in the good Qi sector based on Feng Shui calculation and time factor.

            Covid 19 has accelerated three broad trends that may reshape work after the pandemic recedes
        </p>
        <p>
            Assessing the space based on the purpose or type of usage is one of the most important factors. Key personnel such as CEO, and those in Finance and Sales Departments  or revenue generator team should be place at the good Qi location. It can bring a lot of energy, attention, and opportunities your way. Whereas storage, server room and washroom should be lock at the death Qi location

            Placing employee working desk in the best commanding position in their workplace and workspace. According to Classical Feng Shui analysis we identify the sector with the best element combination to harvest the energy and gain support. Establishing a commanding position allows the employee to literally, energetically, and metaphorically see and feel who and what opportunities are approaching. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each employee are calculated based on their individual date of birth to identify the best direction for their productivity and efficiency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way, "Positioning the desk could symbolize avoiding collaborations with non-beneficial business partners and signing contracts or agreements that are one-sided." 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, to avoid location at the death energy sector (based on Feng Shui formula to identify). These are indications of ”Sha Qi" energy (killing Qi) or life-draining Qi (exhausting Qi). “Negative symptoms from a Feng Shui perspective could be recognized as feeling tired, unfocused, or easily emotionally triggered."
