        <h2> The Future workplaces </h2>
        <p>
                The future of the workplace is increasingly employee-centric, with hybrid working models putting staff firmly in the driving seat in terms of when and where they work. Employees intend to make changes to their working lives after the pandemic, with many planning new daily routines, including changing their working hours and locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technology has transformed the way we meet, share knowledge, access training, and plan tasks and projects. Workers are demanding more freedom and flexibility and are focusing on their work-life balance. Even organizations that can’t offer remote working have a new focus on the wider employee experience, as a legacy of the disruption and challenges of the COVID crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organizations are looking again at many aspects of their working practices. They want to provide flexibility and maximize the benefits of the new ways of working in terms of employee satisfaction and productivity. Post-crisis, they’re building resilience into the workforce, structuring employment and redundancy packages for potential future disruption. And they’re changing how work itself is planned and distributed, expanding the use of temporary workers, and downsizing or reimagining office space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remote work is also changing, much to the dismay of many employees who have adjusted to and favoured the remote lifestyle of the pandemic. An entire week with 100% remote work is becoming less common, with the global pendulum shifting towards hybrid models to adapt to the expanding needs of businesses and the workforce, striking a balance between in-person team creativity, and autonomous working and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workplace trends are business changes expected to continue to grow within coming years. Examples include hybrid work, employee wellness, and ongoing education. The purpose of pointing out trends is to alert employers to industry shifts and help companies build more progressive workplaces.
        </p>

            “Feng Shui can grow your business by creating happier employees
            And drawing in more clients, 
            thus, generating more wealth.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The four trends are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ageless: a workplace which allows ‘returnment’, encouraging older workers to remain or return to the workplace instead of retiring, and sees workers energised to continue to work until a later age because they want to, rather than have to
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mindful: a workplace which nurtures mental health and encourages workers to recharge mentally and achieve balance in their busy hyper-connected, digital lifestyles
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Intuitive: a workplace that uses data and insight on its workers’ environment, mood, wants and needs to create an all-encompassing, intelligent and intuitive environment
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Collaborative: a workplace that embraces the collapse of traditional structures to promote open and social exchange, operating a flat structure and embracing the impact of more women in the workplace
                        </li>
                    </ul>
