The long-term Feng Shui cycle is going through a major reset in **2024**, bringing us to the new era that will last for another 20 years until **3 Feb 2044**.

For every 20 years, there is a major energy change in the Universe. Each 20 years constitute a period and there are a total of 9 periods. The period change is due to the planetary movements and interactions between the Sun and the stars and every transition from one period to another will bring about prominent energetic changes in the world which can show up in changes of various aspects of life such as **industry**, **business trends**, **culture**, **health** and **spirituality**. Knowledge of such changes can then prepare us for the necessary changes in mindset, directions and actions to take which can then assist us to ride on the bandwagon of Period 9 energy instead of against it. 

Fengshui analysis and audits of housing and buildings with consideration of Period 9 energy will enhance the support of the people through the factor of earth. 

**Period 9 starts from 2024** and will last for **20 years till 2044**. The changes will have usually started to kick in a few years before the actual transition. If you observed, you could see major changes in political, businesses and way of living starting from year 2020.

This is an awakening call & reshuffling of new **priorities in life**. There will be a shift in mindset from profit and wealth to purpose and from controlling to empowering and motivation. 

The previous cycle from 2004 until 3 Feb 2024 is influenced by the Earth element, the general attitude of people is all about stability, working hard and be down-to-earth, working and growing with a good company, taking time to build trust and long-term relationship. 

With the transition into new cycle of Fire element and just like the **characteristics of fire**, **security** and **stability** will be challenged just like how the fire flickers. Therefore, career growth should be individually managed with continuous learning and experimentation and individual resilience should be built **financially** and **mentally** rather than being too over dependent on others. Hence health and well-being is given more priority as that is the basis for every other form of development. 

An awakening call for **morality**, **spirituality**, **societal consciousness**, **environment** and **culture** as we reshuffle the priorities in life for higher level consciousness and inspirations rather than earthly pursuits such as **money** and **possessions**.  

We will see a big leap in technology advancement and development of Artificial Intelligence. Business owner and big corporation need to accept that significant or transformative strategic shifts will be necessary on a broad front. We must prepare that years ahead could be very different from the recent past, and that we need to adapt to **survive** and **sustain our business**.
