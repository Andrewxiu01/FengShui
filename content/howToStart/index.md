In life, there are always some factors or areas that has more importance over the others, and it is the same in the world of Feng Shui too. In Home Feng Shui, we always take priority on these 3 most essential areas of our house the main door – 门, the bedroom – 主 and the kitchen – 灶 before we take care of the other areas.

Good home Feng Shui is about attracting positive energy (Qi) into these 3 spaces as it signify bringing wealth and opportunities into your life. In contrast, if these 3 areas have inadequate Qi or are filled with negative energy, you tend to run into obstacles in your life, so let’s explore the basic ways to Feng Shui these spaces.

## Why the importance?
Kitchen has a **VERY important** role in residential Feng Shui. When we do a Feng Shui analysis of a home, the three most important living areas to look at are (1) the front door, (2) the bedroom, and (3) the kitchen.

So now, the kitchen. Why the importance?

In short, it is where Feng Shui energy interacts with Fire, which can be used to suppress negative Qi (and positive Qi as well, but hopefully that’s not the case). It is a highly active area where we snack and prepare food and drinks.

The stove is symbolic of your resources and prosperity in Feng Shui. If we can cook and nourish our bodies well, we can also show up in the world with our best foot forward. 

Feng Shui kitchen is essential when you want to Feng Shui your house. Stove placed in improper places can cause health problems because bad Qi can influence the quality of the food. Also, negative Feng Shui energies produced by the kitchen can be used to suppress other negative Feng Shui elements based on your Life Gua number and house Feng Shui chart.

Although kitchen Feng Shui is important, it is just one part when looking at a home’s Feng Shui. If you truly want to benefit from Feng Shui, I suggest that you find a consultant rather than doing it yourself.

Bedroom is one of the most important rooms in your house to apply the Feng Shui principles. After all, you probably spend the most time in your bedroom.

A Feng Shui bedroom should be peaceful, relaxing, and balanced. You may also notice you’ll sleep better if objects are organized in a certain way. Having a good Feng Shui for your bedroom can lead to better health, luck, and success. 

While there are different perspectives on what to include and omit in a Feng Shui room, most important factors are right location within your bedroom and sleeping at the right direction.
